MBURG is a bottom up tree rewriter in the general style of IBURG. It has
a somewhat different implementation, and produces its output in standard
Modula2.

The sources in this directory are sufficient to create mburg, provided
you have the gpm version of COCO/R on your system. Failing that, all of
the coco-produced sources which you need are in the subdirectory sources.

One full example of a mburg grammar for an experimental tree rewriter for
SPARC is in the directory test.  The compiler from which it was taken
placed a lot of the semantic actions in a helper module CgHelper. Still
it may give you an idea.

There is a postscript reference manual mburg.ps here, and the short 
announcement of availability sigplan.ps.

Enjoy.
